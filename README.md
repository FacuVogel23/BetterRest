# BetterRest

<p>
With this project, I gave my first steps into a fascinating area of programming like machine learning using some wonderful Apple frameworks like Create ML and Core ML, while learning some more SwiftUI skills.

I work through:
</p>

- Entering numbers with Stepper
- Selecting dates and times with DatePicker
- Working with dates
- Training a model with Create ML
- Connecting SwiftUI to Core ML
